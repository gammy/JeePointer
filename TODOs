Ok so here's what I have so far:

- Jeenode/link acting as rf12 receiver and serial to usb converter ("Receiver")
- Jeenode communicating environmental data to the receiver via rf12
	- Currently carries gravity board (3-axis accelerometer data)

Basic concept:
- Have a small wireless "tactor" which can provide environmental data such as
  - lighting
  - positioning (x, y, z)
  - direction (compass)
- This data can be fed in realtime into a receiver plugin, allowing stellarium
  to become "aware" of its surroundings. Point the "tactor" where you want
  stellarium to go.
- One use for this is to pop the "tactor" on your telescope; whatever your
  scope sees, stellarium sees. It's sort of the reverse of GOTO.


TODO:
[X] (Stupid) get slackware to understand (udev?) that I'm the owner of ttyUSB*
[!] Make slackbuild for libftdi-git (this is nontrivial as it uses a custom
				     make system)
    *** I gave up on this, the build system is to esoteric; I spent over
        an hour figuring out how to do it, but it seems impossible. Perhaps
	the git version is not compilable at this time ***
[X] Install precompiled libftdi version, 32-bit
	- Very difficult to compile. Has required a LOT of additional mods
	  to the build script. Now I'm stuck because libusb, from libcompat,
	  is 32-bit. So I have to cross-compile libftdi (and ALL programs 
          hooking into it, including stellarium - an *enormous* undertaking.
	  So frustrated and angry. This is SO FUCKING FAR away from what I
	  want to work on. I don't WANT TO WORK on fucking libftdi, I just
	  want to FUCKING USE IT. I fucking HATE this FUCKING SHIT. I'm NEVER
	  going to reach any of my fucking goals - it's just a fucking
	  never-ending fucking downward spiral. KILL MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeee
	  ........so now I am researching cross-compiling 32 bit code on 64bit
	  when using autoconf. Probably yet another fucking impossible task.
	  Finally did it. 32-bit it is.


    [ ] Make slackbuild for libusb (required by liftdi)
    [ ] Make slackbuild for libconfuse (required by libftdi)

[ ] Write C/C++ interface using libftdi to pull serial data from the receiver
   [ ] Expand interface to become a full-fledged stellarium plugin(C++),
      see http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~stellarium/stellarium/trunk/view/head:/plugins/HelloStelModule/src/HelloStelModule.hpp
[ ] Try to salvage the broken heading board:
    it has temp&hum onboard as well as a heading instrument(compass + z-axis):
[ ] Make my own 'plug' for an LDR so that we can, ultimately, togle night-mode
    in stellarium if it's dark.
